    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Conceived in the late 1980s as a teaching and scripting language, Python has since become an essential tool for many programmers, engineers, researchers, and data scientists across academia and industry.\n",
    "\n",
    "The appeal of Python is in its simplicity and beauty, as well as the convenience of the large ecosystem of domain-specific tools that have been built on top of it. For example, most of the Python code in scientific computing and data science is built around a group of mature and useful packages:\n",
    "• NumPy provides efficient storage and computation for multidi‐ mensional data arrays.\n",
    "• SciPy contains a wide array of numerical tools such as numeri‐ cal integration and interpolation.\n",
    "• Pandas provides a DataFrame object along with a powerful set of methods to manipulate, filter, group, and transform data.\n",
    "• Matplotlib provides a useful interface for creation of publication-quality plots and figures.\n",
    "• Scikit-Learn provides a uniform toolkit for applying common machine learning algorithms to data.\n",
    "\n",

    "The Zen of Python, by Tim Peters\n",
    "Beautiful is better than ugly. Explicit is better than implicit. Simple is better than complex. Complex is better than complicated. Flat is better than nested.\n",
    "Sparse is better than dense.\n",
    "Readability counts.\n",
    "Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules. Although practicality beats purity.\n",
    "Errors should never pass silently.\n",
    "Unless explicitly silenced.\n",
    "In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess. There should be one--and preferably only one--obvious way\n",
    "to do it.\n",
    "Although that way may not be obvious at first unless\n",
    "you're Dutch.\n",
    "Now is better than never.\n",
    "Although never is often better than *right* now.\n",
    "If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.\n",
    "If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea. Namespaces are one honking great idea--let's do more of those!\n",

    "\n",
    "Python code is run using the Python interpreter.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Python code syntax\n",
    "Consider the following example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# set the midpoint \n",
    "midpoint = 5\n",
    "# make two empty lists\n",
    "lower = []; upper = []\n",
    "# split the numbers into lower and upper\n",
    "for i in range(10): \n",
    "  if (i < midpoint):\n",
    "    lower.append(i) \n",
    "  else:\n",
    "    upper.append(i) \n",
    "    \n",
    "  print(\"lower:\", lower)\n",
    "  print(\"upper:\", upper) \n",
    "  \n",
    "# O/P:  \n",
    "# lower: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]\n",
    "# upper: [5, 6, 7, 8, 9]\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Comments are marked by #. Multi-line comments by using /* ... */\n",
    "2. End-Of-Line terminates a statement `midpoint = 5 #end of line`\n",
    "3. Semicolon can optionally Terminate a Statement\n",
    "4. Indentation is used as a block of code\n",
    "5. Whitespace *Within* Lines Does Not Matter\n",
    "6. Parentheses Are for Grouping or Calling\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    In[5]:2*(3+4)\n",
    "    Out [5]: 14\n",

    "## Variables\n",
    "\n",
    "Python variables are pointers.\n",

    "\n",
    "```c\n",
    "// C code\n",
    "int x = 4;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "you are essentially defining a “memory bucket” named x, and putting the value 4 into it. In Python, by contrast, variables are best thought of not as containers but as pointers. So in Python, when you write\n",
    "x=4\n",
    "you are essentially defining a pointer named x that points to some other bucket containing the value 4. "

    "Python addressed this problem by introducing type hinting, which you can sprinkle variables with:\n",
    "\n",
    "By default, type hints provide only informative value since the Python interpreter doesn’t care about them at runtime. However, you can add a separate utility, such as a static type checker, to your tool chain to get an early warning about mismatched types. The type hints are completely optional, which makes it possible to combine dynamically typed code with statically typed code. This approach is known as **gradual typing.**\n",

   ]
  },
  {
   "source": [
    "Here, although the type of the final value is float, the variable declaration is `data: str = 4.5`, this does not give an error because type-hints only provide an informative value and the Python Interpreter doesn't care about them at runtime. You can consider type-hints as comments for displaying 'type' of the variable."

    "### Strongly Typed vs Weakly Typed\n",
    "\n",
    "Python demonstrates strong typing by refusing to act upon objects with incompatible types. For example, you can use the plus (+) operator to add numbers or to concatenate strings, but you can’t mix the two:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    ">>> int('3') + 2\n",
    "5\n",
    "To join the two strings together, you’d cast the second operand accordingly:\n",
    "\n",
    ">>> '3' + str(2)\n",
    ">>> '32'\n",
    "JavaScript, on the other hand, uses weak typing, which automatically coerces types according to a set of rules. Unfortunately, these rules are inconsistent and hard to remember as they depend on operator precedence.\n",
    "\n",
    "Taking the same example as before, JavaScript will implicitly convert numbers to strings when you use the plus (+) operator:\n",
    "\n",
    "> '3' + 2\n",
    "'32'\n",
    "That’s great as long as it’s the desired behavior. Otherwise, you’ll be pulling your hair out trying to find the root cause of a logical error. But it gets even more funky than that. Let’s see what happens if you change the operator to something else:\n",
